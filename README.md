# My Edits Webpage

Welcome to my Edits Webpage! This project showcases various styles of video edits that I have created. Each edit is unique and demonstrates different techniques and transitions.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: The main page that provides an overview and navigation to different edits.
- `edit1.html` to `edit5.html`: Individual pages for each edit.
- `style.css`: The stylesheet for the webpage.
- `script.js`: The script for the functionality of the webpage.

## Fonts Used

This project uses the following Google Fonts:
- Inter
- Press Start 2P
- Rubik

## How to Navigate

On the main page (`index.html`), you will find buttons that link to each of the edits:
- **My Most Popular Edit**
- **My Favourite Soft Edit**
- **A Different Style of Edit**
- **Another Different Style of Edit**
- **The Edit with my Best Transitions**

Click on any button to view the corresponding edit.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open `index.html` in your web browser.

## Future Enhancements

- Add more edits with different styles and techniques.
- Improve the responsiveness of the webpage.
- Add descriptions and details for each edit.
