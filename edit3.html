                <p style = "font-size: 18px;">One of my best friends described the style of this edit to be one that felt like an "Apple ad", and while I definitely hadn't had that in mind when I was creating this edit, I love that that was what she associated with it. This is a different style of edit than what I usually made because of my use of colours (primarily yellow) and other solid layers. The incorporation of lyrics within the edit was something that I had intentionally done to also draw focus to the choice of audio for this edit. I also chose the colour yellow because it is very bright, which I felt was very fitting for the soft tone of the edit, and because the character Alina Starkov is one with the power of light. </p>
                <p>My favourite effect in this edit is <a href = "videos/clip.mp4">this one </a> as the main focus is the sliding transition, but to the rest of the grid, I manipulated the 3d rotation to add some weight to the effect. I also love how I highlighted the center clip of the grid by adding a yellow tint to the rest of the clips, and additionally I ensured that the overlay of the floating yellow circles lay behind the center clip, adding dimensionality to this transition. </p>
